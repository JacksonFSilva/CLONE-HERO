# CLONE HERO - GUITAR HERO PC ARDUINO AS GUITAR GAMEPAD
Hi everyone, 
This is something that I made for fun. 
I had a broke guitar hero controller and wanted to play Clone hero  / Guitar Hero 3 on PC and had an Arduino Leonardo, so I planned to make it work together and it's working very fine e very responsive. 
I'll add some photos and details about it soon, for while here it is the code.
